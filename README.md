<!-- ABOUT -->
<h1>About</h1>

Atomic is an open source Google Chrome developer tool designed for  applications built using [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) as a  state management library. Atomic developer tool provides real-time snapshots of a Jotai application's atomic state and component structure allowing developers to visually inspect their application state and to readily determine development solutions.
</br>

Key features of Atomic devtool include:

- Display state changes between snapshots
- Display component tree structure
- Dynamically rendering graphic component visualization with state changes
- Atom network data visualization for both atom dependents and atom read dependencies




<!-- INSTALLATION -->
<h1>
Getting Started
</h1>

1. #### Install Atomic Chrome extension.

   Add Atomic devtool chrome extension to your chrome browser.

   **_[Pending Chrome Web Store Approval]_**

   Developers can fork our repository and load the extension/build folder unpacked into their Chrome extensions to implement Atomic Devtools.

2. #### Install atomic-devtools Module.

   ```js
   npm install atomic-devtools
   ```

3. #### Import `useAtomicDevtool` & `AtomicDebugger` from the Atomic module.

   ```js
   import { useAtomicDevtool, AtomicDebugger } from 'atomic-devtools';
   ```

4. #### Integrate `AtomicDebugger` as a React component within the application wrapping all application components intended to debug.

   - _`AtomicDebugger` currently extracts Jotai State from it's `Provider` Component. Implementation is required_

   - _Placement of `AtomicDebugger` component relative to `App` component or `Provider` component is not important, so long as all stateful components are children of `AtomicDebugger`_

   - \*`ReactDOM.Render( )` Must receive a document **_'root'_** element from the application as it's argument.

   ```js
   import AtomicDebugger from 'atomic-devtools';
   import { Provider } from 'jotai';

   function App() {
     return (
        <AtomicDebugger>
            <Provider>
                {Application Components}
            </Provider>
       </AtomicDebugger>
     );
   }

   ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

   ```

5. #### While developing your application, utilize `useAtomicDevtool` hook in place of Jotai's `useAtom` hook to send atom's config to Atomic Devtools.

   ```ts
   function useAtomicDevtool(atom: anyAtom, name: string);
   ```

   `useAtomicDevtool` is an Atomic hook that manages Atomic devtool integration for a particular atom. The hook accepts two arguments, `atom` and `name`. `atom` is the atom that will be connected to the devtools instance. `name` is a string label for identifying the atom for the devtools instance.

   ### Example

   ```js
   import { useAtomicDevtool } from 'atomic-devtools';

   const anAtom = atom('example')


   function SomeComponent() {
        const [value, updateValue] = useAtomicDevtool(anAtom, 'anAtomName');

        ...
   }
   ```

6. #### Open your application on the Chrome Browser and start debugging with Atomic devtool!

   **Important**- Only supported with React applications using Jotai as state management.

   **Important**- Only intended for development (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`).

Features
</h1>

- ### State Change Display

  Easily compare atom state changes between snapshots in real-time.

- ### Component Graph Visualization

  Atomic provides a data visualization of an applications React component tree. Have the ability to see a hierarchical view of all the React components in an application. The component graph provides the locations of each useAtom invocation per components, as well provides real-time data on an atom's value, dependents, and read dependencies for a specific snapshot.

- ### Atom Network Visualization of Dependents and Read Dependencies

  Visualize an atom's dependents
  _(displays all atoms affected by an atom)_ and read dependencies _(displays all atoms that affect the inspected atom)_.

- ### Component Tree

  Displays the applications React component structure with subscribed atom(s) for a given snapshot.

<!-- UPCOMING FEATURES -->

WIP
</h1>

- ### Time Travel
  Currently, the ability to jump between state changes within the devtool is feasible. The snapshot list provides the state throughout the Jotai-built application runtime and each time state changes, a new snapshot is added. We intend to develop functionality that will, pressing the jump button next to each snapshot, revert application state to the desired historical snapshot.
